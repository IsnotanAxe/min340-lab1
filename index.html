                <h3>Stuff about Daniel </h3>
                <p>One of my favorite books ever is Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The movie based on it, Blade Runner, was one of my favorite movies ever since I was a kid, and I'm really glad I ended up loving the book so much too</p>
                <p>Some interesting facts about me are that I am left-handed, colorblind, and a twin. Pretty low odds for all of those together, probably. I love movies, even terrible ones. I love going camping, and was a boy scout for a long time as a kid.</p>
                <p>Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies, but my favorite ever is probably <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622> 2001: A Space Odyssey</a>. My dad showed it to me as a kid and I didn't understand it at all, but growing older and watching it more as I grew up and started learning more about movies and loving movies more I began to really love it. I still watch it every year with my dad for my birthday. Some of my other favorite movies include The Thing and Alien. I've always loved horror and science-fiction ever since I was a kid so both togehter make some of my favorite movies.</p>
                <p>Seeing my family and hanging out with my friends always makes me happy.</p>
